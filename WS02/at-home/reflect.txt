1)Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase 
the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory?
Because we can't add one more memory into our existing dynamic memory, 
so we need to allocate a new dynamic memory that has size of three. 

2)The Kingdom structure stores the name of the kingdom in an array 
of characters. At the end of the program, we do not use the delete 
operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the name itself. 
Why don’t we need to use the delete e operator on this array itself? 
Because when we deallocate the pkingdom dynamic memory we also delete 
the data in our Kingdom structure.

3)There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the 
compiler know which definition to call from your main function? 
The compiler can distinguish two functions with same name by their parameter types 
and the order of the parameter types.

4)Describe what have you have learned in this workshop.
I understand what the meaning of dynamic memory is and how it works.
Also, when we have function overloading problem, how we can fix this problem. 

Quiz 1 Reflection

1.
It can avoid we use wrong identifier within different namespaces.

2.
Because .h files only contain function prototypes and declarations, 
no any implementation code.

3.
#include <iostream>
#include "hello.h"
using namespace std;
using namespace sict;

4.
g++ -std=c++0x main_app.cpp hello.cpp
