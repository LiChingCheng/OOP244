1.What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
   Some variables or functions have same name in entire file. 
We use namespace to ensure the scope of variables or functions are what we want to use. 
Make sure we won’t use different scope of variables or functions.

2.Why are header files needed? Explain.
   We need header files to store function prototypes that be used in our .cpp file. If we don’t have 
 header files means we don’t have the function declarations, the main() function wouldn’t 
know what the function is. 

3.In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files 
but not the .h files. Explain why you should never compile header files.
   Header files don't need to be compiled because they only contain passive code such as function prototypes.
Passive code doesn't need to be executed because it is not a implementation file.

4.Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file.
   If we include .cpp files in another file, compiler will compile twice for one code.
It breaks the one-definition rule and will show errors.

5.Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.
   From this workshop, I learned why we should use namespace in our code, 
and how to create and use a namespace in our .h and .cpp files. 
Also, how the #ifndef and #endif two functions work in our code.
