1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? 
   Does your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain. 
If we put our templated functions in Dtaa.cpp file, our program won't work.
Also it can't compile if we move all functions to Data.h file.

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you need to define 
   the template function above main(), before it is used, or can you define it below main()? 
No, it doesn't work, either.

3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your functions
   in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the advantage of using templates?  
Yes, we can. But we will have several overloading functions and it will be more complex than now.

4. Are the following equivalent?  template<class T>  template<typename T>
Yes, when I change typename to class, my program works.
