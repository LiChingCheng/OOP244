1)How many elements are there in each C-style character string 
that stores a family or given name for the account? Why? 
   40 elements, because we define the max length of name is 40, 
so we can only store 40 characters in each C-style character string.


2)Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  
In C, this would generate an error.  Name the feature of C++ that allows this.
   When we have two same name of member functions, C++ will check their parameter 
types next and then check the order of the parameter types. If parameter types 
and the order the parameter types are different, C++ will accept that.


3)What have you learned in completing this workshop? 
   Through this workshop, I learned 
1.how to create a class and an object
2.how the private and public work 
3.what the data members and member functions are doing.

 Quiz 2 Reflection:
1.	
Dynamic memory can save the space for user because it will 
ask how many space do we need then give us correct number of spaces.

2.	
It passes parameter by reference.

3.	
Char* word=nullptr;
Word=new char[7];
Strcpy(word,”OOP244”);
Delete[] word;
Word=nullptr;
