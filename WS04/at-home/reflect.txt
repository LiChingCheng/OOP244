1)What is a safe empty state? Could you define a safe empty state that differs from the empty state that you defined? 
   Safe empty state means that we initialize our objects as a default values that we 
set in the constructor(not empty state, e.g Null or nullptr). It can make sure our objects won’t contain garbage values.

2)Identify the parts of your source code where to minimized code duplication. 
   We minimized our code by using constructors to initialize our objects at creation-time 
which have no parameter or invalid parameters.  

3)The canTravelWith(...) member function accesses the private data of the object referenced 
in its parameter. Explain why C++ allows this access.
   Because our objects are pass the value by reference to the function.

4)What statement did you add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes correctly? 
   We need to include <cstring> to ensure the function “strncpy()” can executes correctly.

5)Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
   In this workshop, I learned how to use construction and why we use destruction when we create a construction. 


Quiz 3 Reflection
1.Member functions is a link between private data members and client code.
2.A class is a data type and an object is an instance of a class.
