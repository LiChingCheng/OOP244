1.The operator+ returns a Fraction object. 
Explain why this operator should not return a reference to a Fraction object.
If we return the reference of the temporary object, it gives us garbage value 
because the temporary object will be cleaned up before we go out of the scope. 
If we want to return a reference of an object, that object must be a exist object not a temporary object.

2.List the temporary objects in the w5_at_home.cpp main module.
(a+b) and (b+d) object.

3.List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize code duplication.
We use two constructors to minimize our code so that we don’t need to 
initialize several times for each object.  

4.Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
In this workshop, I learned how to create member operators, and how it works for us.
