1) Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before doing anything else? 
   If our current object is equal to the source object, means they are point to the same address.
If we don't check for self-assignment, when we deallocate the memory, those data which are store
in the momery will be gone. As the result, we have nothing to copy. 

2) List examples of how you avoided code duplication. 
   We use two constructors to reduce our code when we create the new object and use overloaded operator
+= to add more data into our object without writing same code again. Also, we use overloaded operator =
to make a same value but different object in our code.

3) List what you have learned in completing this workshop. 
   In this workshop, I learned how to code the copy constructor, copy assignment operator, 
and overloaded operator. Also, I know why we need to deallocate the memory before we allocate
another dynamic memory.
